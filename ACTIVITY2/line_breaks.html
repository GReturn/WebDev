        <h4>Acitivity 2.1: Headings, Paragraphs, and <u>Text Formatting</u></h4>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>
            This paragraph incorporates some of the text formatting styles in HTML. 
            <b>The bold tag is incorporated in this sentence,</b>
            <i>while the italicized tag is used in this section of the sentence.</i>
            The <tt>monospaced tag</tt> is rarely used in building websites;
            it's usually the <b>bold text</b>, <i>italicized</i>, and <u>underlined text</u>
            that are mostly used.

            Although this website might look exactly the same, there's a minor difference. 
            First, the <b>br tag</b> was included and it is placed between the two heading tags.
            Second, the <i>horizontal line</i> was also incorporated to create division or sections in the website.<br>
            Lastly, an image was embedded in this website. The image has a dimensions of <i>500 x 300 pixels</i>.
